# Introduction

In the modern distributed architecture, Infrastructure monitoring has become crucial, there are many components which contributes for system stability, In this blog post we will see how end to end observability of Messaging queues can be achieved using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and the problems it can solve to ensuring stability and scalability of Distributed Asynchronous Architectures.

Today there are solutions which can help with visualising out of the box [JMX metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html) from a Messaging queues like Kafka, but it’s still hard to see what’s happening in a single trace and how kafka components are affecting every request. We will see what can be done to improve the reliability and performance by using client side instrumentation of async systems using OpenTelemetry.
