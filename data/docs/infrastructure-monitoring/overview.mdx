### Host Details

Selecting a host opens a detailed view with three main sections: Metrics, Traces, and Logs.

### Metrics Tab

Monitor host performance metrics across customizable time periods.

    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/docs/infrastructure-monitoring/host-traces-details.webp" alt="Traces Tab"/>
    <figcaption><i>Traces Tab</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Features:**
- Adjustable time range selection for trace analysis
- Advanced filtering capabilities to focus on specific trace attributes
- Direct integration with the traces explorer for deeper analysis
- The "Explore in Traces Explorer" button opens the trace in the full interface, retaining time ranges and filters

**Filter Options:**
- **Service name**: Focus on traces from specific services
- **Operation type**: Filter by specific operations or endpoints (e.g., GET, POST)
- **Status/Error codes**: Identify traces with specific success or error statuses
- **Custom attributes**: Refine traces using user-defined tags or metadata

### Logs Tab

Access and search through host logs with powerful filtering capabilities.

    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/docs/infrastructure-monitoring/host-logs-details.webp" alt="Logs Tab"/>
    <figcaption><i>Logs Tab</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Features:**
- Configurable time range selection for log analysis
- Comprehensive filtering system
- Seamless integration with the logs explorer
- The "Explore in Logs Explorer" button opens the full logs interface, keeping time ranges and filters

**Filter Categories:**
- **Log Levels**: Filter logs by severity (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR).
- **Service Components**: Focus on specific services or application components generating the logs.
- **Message Content**: Search for specific keywords or patterns in log messages.
- **Custom Fields**: Apply filters based on user-defined metadata fields for more tailored insights.
