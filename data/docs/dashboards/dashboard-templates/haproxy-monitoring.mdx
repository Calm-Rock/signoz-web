## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential HAProxy metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Network Performance**: Track inbound and outbound network traffic and bandwidth usage
- **Analyze Request/Response Patterns**: Monitor request rates, total requests, and response statistics
- **Track Connection Health**: Monitor connection rates, errors, and retry attempts
- **Monitor Session Management**: Analyze session counts, rates, and averages
- **Identify Performance Issues**: Track error rates, denied requests, and queued operations
- **Load Balancer Health Monitoring**: Keep track of overall HAProxy performance and availability
