title: HAProxy Monitoring Dashboard
description: Monitor comprehensive HAProxy load balancer metrics including network traffic, connection rates, request/response statistics, session management, and error analysis for performance optimization.
---

This dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of HAProxy load balancer operations, offering detailed visibility into network traffic, connection rates, request/response statistics, session management, and error analysis. Built on top of available [HAProxy metrics from OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/haproxy/).

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential HAProxy metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Network Performance**: Track incoming and outgoing network traffic patterns
- **Analyze Request Flow**: Monitor request rates, queued requests, and request processing
- **Track Connection Health**: Monitor connection rates, errors, and retry patterns
- **Session Management**: Track session counts, rates, and average session metrics
- **Error Analysis**: Monitor request/response errors and 5xx error patterns
- **Load Balancer Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize HAProxy performance
