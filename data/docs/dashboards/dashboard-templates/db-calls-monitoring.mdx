## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential database metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Database Performance**: Track database transaction rates and response times
- **Identify Top Database Operations**: Analyze the most frequently executed database statements
- **Track Database Errors**: Monitor database error rates and identify problematic queries
- **Optimize Slow Queries**: Identify and analyze the slowest database calls for optimization
- **Database Health Monitoring**: Keep track of overall database system health and performance

## Metrics Included

### DB Transaction Rate
- **Chart Type**: Time series graph
- **Metrics**: Database transaction rate over time (req/s)
- **Grouping**: By database name (dbName)
- **Purpose**: Monitor the volume of database transactions to identify traffic patterns and load

### Top DB Statements
- **Chart Type**: Table view
- **Columns**:
  - **dbName**: Database name
  - **db.statement**: The actual database statement/query
  - **Total Calls**: Total number of calls for each statement
  - **Average Duration**: Average execution time in nanoseconds
  - **Rate**: Requests per second for each statement
- **Purpose**: Identify the most frequently executed database statements and their performance characteristics

### DB Error Rate
- **Chart Type**: Time series graph
- **Metrics**: Database error percentage over time
- **Calculation**: (Error count / Total count) Ã— 100
- **Grouping**: By database name (dbName)
- **Purpose**: Monitor database error trends and identify problematic periods

### Slowest DB Calls
- **Chart Type**: List view with pagination
- **Columns**:
  - **Timestamp**: When the database call occurred
  - **serviceName**: Service making the database call
  - **name**: Operation name
  - **durationNano**: Duration in nanoseconds
  - **db.statement**: The database statement executed
  - **dbOperation**: Type of database operation
- **Sorting**: Ordered by duration (descending) to show slowest calls first
- **Purpose**: Identify and analyze the slowest database operations for performance optimization

## OpenTelemetry Integration

This dashboard is built on top of available database attributes from OpenTelemetry, following the [OpenTelemetry database semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/db/). The dashboard leverages the following key attributes:

- `dbSystem`: Database management system identifier
- `dbName`: Database name
- `db.statement`: Database statement being executed
- `dbOperation`: Type of database operation
- `serviceName`: Name of the service making the database call
- `hasError`: Boolean indicating if the operation resulted in an error
- `durationNano`: Duration of the database operation in nanoseconds

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **service_name**: Filter by specific service names making database calls (supports single selection)

## Use Cases

This dashboard is particularly useful for:

- **Database Performance Optimization**: Identify slow queries and optimize database performance
- **Error Monitoring**: Track database errors and investigate root causes
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor database load patterns to plan for scaling
- **Service-Level Monitoring**: Filter by service to understand how different services interact with databases
- **Query Analysis**: Analyze the most frequently executed queries and their performance impact
