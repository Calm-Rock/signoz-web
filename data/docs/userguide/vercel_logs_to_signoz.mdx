# Send Telemetry data from Vercel to SigNoz

Now you can send your telemetry data to SigNoz from Vercel using the SigNoz Vercel [Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/signoz).

## Vercel Configuration
* Add the [Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/signoz).
* Select the Vercel account that you want to use.
* Select the projects for which you want to send the telemetry data.
* Click on add integration and the SigNoz UI open up.
* Enter the region of your SigNoz cloud instance.
* Enter the ingestion token of your SigNoz cloud instance.
* Click on Integrate to complete the integration


Once the above is completed, you will get your logs data in SigNoz.
## Send trace data on SigNoz  
For sending trace data to SigNoz you will have to make some changes to your application code.
Please follow this [guide](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/otel-overview). 


# Old Process
If you are running your applications on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), you can stream logs from Vercel to SigNoz using [log drains](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/log-drains-overview/log-drains#configure-a-log-drain).

Log Drains are only supported in Vercel Pro and Enterprise accounts.

## Stream Vercel logs to SigNoz in SigNoz cloud
* From the Vercel dashboard, go to Team Settings > Log Drains.
* Select sources to collect logs
  ![Vercel sources](/img/logs/vercel/sources.webp)
* Choose delivery format as `JSON`
* Choose your target projects
* Enter the endpoint.
    It will be 
    ```
    https://ingest.<REGION>.signoz.cloud:443/logs/json
    ```

  Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the otlp endpoint will vary according to this table.

  | Region | Endpoint                   |
  | ------ | -------------------------- |
  | US     | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
  | IN     | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
  | EU     | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

* Enable custom headers and add the headers `signoz-access-token` and `x-vercel-verify`
  The value of `x-vercel-verify` will be visible on the screen and `signoz-access-token` will be the token you use for sending data to SigNoz

* Click on `Test Log Drain` , if successful you will see sample logs on SigNoz UI (Might take some time).

* Click on `Verify` button and then `Add Log Drain` in Vercel.

Now your logs will be sent to SigNoz.
