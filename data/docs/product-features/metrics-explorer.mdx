title: Metrics Explorer in SigNoz
---

## Introduction

The Metrics Explorer page in SigNoz enables developers and SREs to interactively explore, query, and visualize metrics collected from their applications and infrastructure—all in one unified interface.

There are three main sections in the Metrics Explorer:

- [Summary View](#summary-view)
- [Explorer View](#explorer-view)
- [Inspect View](#inspect-view)

## Operations on Data

### Search

The search feature in Metrics Explorer allows you to find different metrics based on various attributes. Users can filter using specific attribute keys and values.

You can also search for metrics by their metric names.

## Views

There are three available views in Metrics Explorer:

### Summary View

As the name suggests, this view provides a summarized overview of all available metrics. Users can search, apply filters, and inspect various details about each metric.

#### Timeseries

A timeseries represents a unique combination of a metric name and its associated label set, capturing how the metric evolves over time for a specific context (like a pod, container, or host).
The number of timeseries a metric has doesn't depend on how many attributes it contains, but rather on the **number of unique combinations of attribute values**.
Only attributes that vary contribute to distinct timeseries—static or unused labels don’t increase timeseries count.
For example, a metric with 10 attributes will result in just one timeseries if all the values remain constant, but could generate thousands if a few labels vary frequently.

#### Samples

Samples are the raw data points collected over time for each timeseries, consisting of a timestamp and a value.
While timeseries define the structure of the data, samples define its volume—a single timeseries can contain thousands of samples depending on the scrape interval and selected time range.
A high sample count doesn’t necessarily imply high cardinality but does impact storage, query performance, and dashboard responsiveness.
For instance, 10,000 timeseries scraped every 15 seconds can generate over 40 million samples per hour.

The Summary View is divided into two parts:

- TreeMap View
- Table View

#### TreeMap View

The TreeMap View provides a visual breakdown of metric cardinality by illustrating how different metrics contribute to total timeseries and sample volume.
Each rectangle represents a distinct metric, and its size reflects its relative contribution. This allows users to easily spot metrics with high cardinality or high sample generation.
It helps in optimizing resource usage, identifying outliers, and making informed decisions around instrumentation and retention.

Users can toggle the TreeMap to view data based on either timeseries or samples.

#### Table View

The Table View presents a structured overview of all metrics in the selected time range, allowing you to inspect metadata and usage statistics at a glance.
Each row displays the metric name, description, unit, number of timeseries, and number of samples—helping you evaluate the purpose and impact of each metric.
This makes it easier to detect under-documented or bloated metrics and streamline observability workflows.

</figure>

**Note:** Both the Treemap and Table Views reflect data only for the **selected time range**, ensuring that all timeseries and sample counts are relevant and scoped.

---

By clicking on any specific metric, users can explore its detailed metadata and label structure.
The detailed view shows all keys and values (labels), total and active timeseries, and the timestamp of the last received sample—crucial for spotting inactive or stale metrics.
This empowers teams to fine-tune metrics, eliminate noise, and optimize data pipelines.

</figure>

Users can also edit metric metadata such as unit, description, metric type, and temporality.
Note that changes to **Metric Type and Temporality** only affect SigNoz’s interpretation and calculations—they do not alter the data at the source.

### Explorer View

The Explorer View acts as a **playground** where users can freely experiment with metrics and queries.
You can write and run multiple queries, visualize them side-by-side, and compare trends—all within one panel.
This is ideal for ad-hoc analysis, debugging, and exploratory data investigation before committing to dashboards or alerts.

    <figcaption><i>Explorer View in Metrics Explorer</i></figcaption>
</figure>

In SigNoz, the **One Chart per Query** mode lets users visualize each query in a separate chart.
This is helpful when comparing metrics with different units (e.g., CPU in percentage vs memory in bytes) but similar trends.
By splitting them visually, you preserve clarity and avoid scale distortion, making it easier to analyze patterns independently and in correlation.

    <figcaption><i>One Chart per query in Metrics Explorer</i></figcaption>

Users can also **save custom views** in the Explorer for quick access to frequently used queries during incident response or analysis.

#### Related Metrics

The Related Metrics section enhances troubleshooting by surfacing metrics that commonly occur alongside the one you’re analyzing.
Based on shared labels or similar trends, this view helps uncover dependencies, correlations, or cascading failures.
For example, a spike in `cpu.utilization` may correlate with `container.restarts` or `k8s.pod.cpu.limit`, guiding you toward the root cause faster.

### Inspect View

The Inspect View is a learning and debugging tool that helps users understand **how their queries are processed**.
It visually demonstrates how space (label-based) and temporal (time-based) aggregations work, and how multiple raw timeseries combine to form the final output.
This helps users identify the most suitable aggregation strategy—like summing across containers, averaging across nodes, or picking the max over time.

Users can toggle between graph and table views, and use the **Point Inspector** to examine how different timeseries contribute to a specific data point—enhancing transparency and learning.
