## Introduction

Monitoring your AWS infrastructure can quickly become complex—especially when dealing with multiple services and regions. The AWS Integration Agent by SigNoz 
simplifies this process by providing a one-click solution to ingest CloudWatch metrics and logs directly into SigNoz.

With this integration, you can:
- View your telemetry data logs and metrics in a single unified dashboard.
- Eliminate the need for manual setup using CLI or custom scripts.
- Automatically collect data across multiple AWS regions and services with minimal ongoing effort.

## Why Use the AWS Integration Agent?

- **One-Click Setup** – Skip complex AWS CLI or manual CloudFormation steps.
- **Auto-Discovery & Maintenance** – Automatically detects new EC2/RDS instances and log groups.
- **Multi-Region Support** – Collect telemetry across any AWS region.
- **Unified Telemetry** – Bring CloudWatch logs and metrics into SigNoz for a single-pane view.

## Getting Started

Before starting, ensure you have necessary permissions and access to your AWS account. This guide will walk you through connecting your AWS account and configuring the integration agent.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Connect Your AWS Account

1. **Choose the region** to install the integration agent.
2. **Select regions to monitor** – You can monitor one or more enabled AWS regions.
3. **Launch the CloudFormation stack**:
   - Pre-filled with required parameters.
   - Acknowledge permissions.
   - Deploy the stack.

This creates:
- ECS Task for the agent
- IAM roles
- Log group for agent logs
- Firehose delivery streams


### 2. Select Services to Monitor

After agent installation:

- Select services to monitor (e.g., EC2, RDS).
- Choose what to collect: **Metrics**, **Logs**, or **Both**.

The agent will:
- Auto-detect namespaces (e.g., `AWS/EC2`)
- Identify relevant log groups (e.g., `/aws/rds/...`)
- Set up CloudWatch Metric Streams and Log Subscriptions
- Provision Firehose streams to send data to SigNoz


### 3. View Data in SigNoz

- Access pre-built dashboards for EC2, RDS, etc.
- Logs and metrics start streaming within minutes.
- Status updates to **Connected** once ingestion begins.


## Advanced Configuration

You can add more AWS regions or services to your existing integration anytime. Follow the steps below to expand data collection:

## Add More Regions or Services

Need to expand?

- Open the integration UI
- Check additional regions or services
- The agent will deploy new telemetry stacks automatically


## Removing the Integration

If you wish to disconnect the integration, follow these steps to clean up all resources:

## Remove the Integration

To disconnect:

1. Click **Remove Integration** in the SigNoz UI.
2. The agent deletes telemetry stacks across all regions.
3. Manually delete the initial CloudFormation stack to fully uninstall.


## Supported Services

Currently, the AWS Integration Agent supports the following AWS services:

- EC2 Metrics
- RDS Metrics & Logs

<Info>More AWS services are being added frequently. Stay tuned via the UI or [changelog](https://signoz.io/changelog).</Info>


## IAM Permissions

The CloudFormation stack automatically sets up all necessary IAM roles and permissions, including:
- ECS task roles
- Firehose delivery roles
- Metric stream and log subscription permissions

All permissions are pre-configured in the CloudFormation stack.


## Deployment Time

Here’s how long you can expect the setup to take:

- Agent installation: ~2 minutes
- Data setup per service: ~1–2 minutes


## Troubleshooting & FAQs

- Ensure IAM permissions are correctly set up.
- Check CloudFormation stack status for errors.
